<p class="story">
Whilst working on the BBC News websites I developed results maps and other visualisations for <span class="more" more="2 UK general elections, 1 US presidential election, 5 UK local council elections, 2 Scottish parliament elections, 2 Welsh assembly elections and 1 EU parliamentary election">a lot of elections</span>.
</p>
<p class="story">
In addition to results visualisations I also produced explanatory graphics for use during the campaign. My favourite of these is the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/election_2010/8609989.stm">parliamentary seat calculator</a>.

I first prototyped the seat calculator straight after the 2005 general election an expression of my frustration with the limitations of the hoary old swingometer esp. its online incarnations. It was obvious that the interaction of the three main parties at the polls was increasingly important and I wanted to make tangible how that interaction could effect election results.

After 5 years of sitting in the prototypes folder on my hard drive I got the chance to dust it off and work out how to make the interface more intuitive for the 2010 election. It took a few goes to get right but with rapid prototyping and rigorous refinement based on watching a whole load of very patient people interact with those prototypes we produced an application of which I'm still really proud and which was well recieved by both <a href="http://boingboing.net/2010/04/19/lib-dems-soar-in-uk.html">casual users</a> and <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/apr/24/clegg-electoral-reform-tactics-romance">experts</a>.
