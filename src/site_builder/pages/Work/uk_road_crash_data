		Working closely with a journalist to analyse, process and clean police records of 11 years worth of road crash data we then produced a postcode searchable map of road deaths, a series of case studies and some spectacular visualisations of the complete data set.

		For the main fatalities map we decided early on that we wanted to try to make the details of individual accidents more affecting than the raw data, we felt it was important that the personal tragedies represented by each point on the map weren't abstracted&mdash;people should be able to feel what each point means&mdash;but at the same time we didn't want to be emotionally manipulative or risk awkward uncanny valley-esq descriptions of horiffic events. To that end we experimented with the range of tones and composition techniques that it was possible to genrate from the data. In the end we came up with something which I think&mdash;whilst not perfect&mdash;strikes a good balance.

		Whilst the project was <a href="http://www.itsnicethat.com/articles/bbc-every-road-death-in-great-britain-1999-2010">well recieved</a> some criticism was aimed at the high level visualisation of the whole data set along the lines of &quot;Well it only really tels us what we already know; accidents happen on roads, more often where there are more people&quot;. Whilst this is true I think this kind of imagery can be useful as a way into the story, both as a kind of advertising image and as a way to illustrate sheer scale&mdash;over eleven years there's been an accident on pretty much every road in London and the whole countries road network can be traced out in collisions, I think that's worth showing.
