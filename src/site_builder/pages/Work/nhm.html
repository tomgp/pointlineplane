		Before my stretch at the BBC I worked at The Natural History Museum. I built gallery infomation systems for "<a href="http://www.nhm.ac.uk/visit-us/whats-on/daytime-events/shows-and-hands-on/investigate/index.html">Investigate</a>"&mdash;the museums award winning education gallery.

		 My job included design, front end, back end and database developement, hardware specing, purchasing and instalation, staff training, system maintenance and repairs. Basically everything apart from writing about the specimens. Museums operate on a tight budget.

		Working at the museum I gained a great appreciation for the value of seeing real people really using your software. It's an amazing and humbling experience to be able to deploy something to a public gallery and then 5 minutes later to be able to watch people stuggle with what you thought was perfectly intuitive.
